    "instruction": "Explain the concept of machine learning in simple terms.",
    "response": "Machine learning is a type of artificial intelligence that allows computers to learn from data without being explicitly programmed. Instead of following rigid instructions, machine learning systems identify patterns in data and use those patterns to make predictions or decisions. For example, a machine learning system can learn to recognize cats in photos by studying thousands of cat images."

    "response": "Here's a Python function to calculate factorial:\n\n```python\ndef factorial(n):\n    if n < 0:\n        raise ValueError('Factorial is not defined for negative numbers')\n    if n == 0 or n == 1:\n        return 1\n    result = 1\n    for i in range(2, n + 1):\n        result *= i\n    return result\n```\n\nThis function handles edge cases and uses iteration to compute the factorial efficiently."
